Estimated length: ~3 minutes. Read slowly and smile!

0:00 - 0:05  — TITLE SLIDE / Intro shot (camera on you, small)
Narration: "Face Golden Ratio Checker — Run it in VS Code."
On-screen: Title text + small webcam circle.

0:05 - 0:20  — Quick hello + what we'll do (screen + webcam)
Narration: "Hi! In this short video I'll show you how to open the project in Visual Studio Code, run it with Live Server, and see your face golden-ratio results live from your webcam."
On-screen: Show VS Code window and browser.

0:20 - 0:40  — Step 1: Open VS Code and create a folder
Narration: "First, open Visual Studio Code. Create a new folder named 'face-golden-ratio' and open it in VS Code. I'll make an index.html file inside."
On-screen: Show creating folder, right-click New File -> index.html.

0:40 - 1:05  — Step 2: Paste the code
Narration: "Copy the provided index.html code and paste it into the file. Save (Cmd/Ctrl+S). This code asks for camera permissions and runs face detection in your browser."
On-screen: Paste code, save file.

1:05 - 1:35  — Step 3: Install Live Server extension
Narration: "Open Extensions (left bar), search 'Live Server', and click Install. After installing, click 'Go Live' at the bottom right."
On-screen: Install Live Server, point to 'Go Live'.

1:35 - 1:55  — Step 4: Allow camera and test
Narration: "Your browser will open a localhost page. Click 'Allow' when it asks for camera access. Move your face into view and wait a second — landmarks will appear and the numbers will update."
On-screen: Browser popup Allow -> show face points and results.

1:55 - 2:25  — Step 5: Use page controls
Narration: "Use 'Take snapshot' to freeze the frame, or 'Resume live' to continue. Try different angles and lighting to see changes."
On-screen: Click snapshot, resume.

2:25 - 2:45  — Troubleshooting tips
Narration: "If nothing shows, check camera permissions, try a different browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox), or open DevTools (F12) to view console errors."
On-screen: Quick view of permissions and DevTools.

2:45 - 3:00  — Outro
Narration: "That's it! You made it. If you want, re-record a clean video with better lighting or follow along with the teleprompter file included in the kit. Bye!"
On-screen: Call-to-action: "Try it now!" + small webcam.

--- NOTES FOR RECORDER ---
- Speak clearly and slowly.
- Keep each line short so editing is easy.
- Use the teleprompter.html in this kit to read the narration while recording.
